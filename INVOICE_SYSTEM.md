## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Invoice Generation Flow

1. **Customer Places Order** → Order is created with status "pending"
2. **Customer Uploads Payment Proof** → Order moves to "paid" status
3. **Admin Verifies Payment** → `/api/admin/orders/[id]/verify` is called
4. **Servers Are Created** → Pterodactyl servers are provisioned
5. **Order Marked Complete** → Status changes to "completed"
6. **Invoice Auto-Generated** → System creates invoice with unique number
7. **Customer Can View Invoice** → Available in `/dashboard/invoices`

### Invoice Data Structure

```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: string
  invoiceNumber: string          // BYTE-YYYY-XXXXX
  orderId: string                 // Links to order
  userId: string                  // Customer ID
  customerName: string
  customerEmail: string
  items: Array<{                  // Itemized services
    name: string
    description: string           // Server specs
    quantity: number
    price: number
    total: number
  }>
  subtotal: number
  discount: number
  tax: number
  total: number
  status: "paid" | "pending" | "cancelled"
  dueDate: Date
  paidDate: Date | null
  createdAt: Date
}
```
