## Notes

1. **Performance**: The drag-and-drop feature updates all product orders in real-time. For large product catalogs (100+ products), consider implementing debouncing.

2. **Media Storage**: Currently, media files are stored locally in `public/uploads/chat/`. For production, consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.).

3. **Security**: All endpoints require authentication. Media uploads validate file types and sizes.

4. **Backwards Compatibility**: All changes are backwards compatible with existing data.

## Future Enhancements

   - Schedule announcements for future dates
   - Target announcements to specific user groups
   - Analytics on announcement views/dismissals

2. **Chat Media**:

   - In-chat image viewer/lightbox
   - Progress indicators for large uploads

3. **Product Ordering**:
